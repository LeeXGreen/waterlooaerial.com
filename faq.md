**• Are you FAA certified?**

This is an important question to ask any provider of drone services. As a remote pilot, I have my Part 107 certification with the FAA. I am familiar with local airspace, and I know when and where I can legally fly. Additionally, every drone we use is registered with the FAA.

**• Why "Waterloo Aerial"?**

I wanted a name that evoked classic Austin but wasn't too cookie-cutter.  

Before Austin was the capital of Texas, it was a tiny village called Waterloo on the north shore of the Colorado River. After Texas independence, it was chosen as the new national capital and renamed for Stephen F. Austin. The city's original name lives on in other local businesses like Waterloo Ice House and Waterloo Records, as well as Waterloo Park near the capitol.
