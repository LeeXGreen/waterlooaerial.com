            Are buyers seeing your properties from the best angle? A 2017 report based on MLS statistics concluded that
            homes with aerial photos sell up to 68% faster. Aerial photos give a great sense of the overall scope of a
            property, and can help to show the location relative to neighborhood landmarks.
